# C4 Diagram – Describe First Rule

## Rule
The agent must ALWAYS describe a C4 diagram in text before generating a visual diagram.

## Description Format
Each diagram description must include:

1. Diagram Type
   - Context / Container / Component

2. Purpose
   - Why this diagram exists

3. Elements
   - List of systems, containers, or components
   - One-line responsibility per element

4. Relationships
   - Who talks to whom
   - Direction of interaction
   - Reason for interaction

5. Assumptions
   - Explicit assumptions or uncertainties

## Human Checkpoint
After producing the description:
- STOP
- Ask the user to confirm or correct
- Do NOT generate Mermaid until approved
